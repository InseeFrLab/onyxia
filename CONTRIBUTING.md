### PR Requirements

Below are some simple rules to adopt Onyxia UI best practices:
- Code in english
- Ensure to edit eloquent files & folders, splitting different layers (react / redux for instance)
- Adopt as you can the new [React](https://reactjs.org/docs) features & a functional approach thanks to [ES6](http://es6-features.org) at least.
- Be sure to activate `Prettier` plugin in your favorite IDE (activating `formatOnSave` property) to have the benefits of the project configuration and build nice git diff.
